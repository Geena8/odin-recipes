My first assignment
This assignment is to create a recipe list in order to review what has been learnt in this chapter.
HTML concepts looked at will be used in the creation of this website.
The DOCTYPE is the first thing to be declared.
Then the HTML element must be added. Also the lang ="en" and the closing tag should be added.
This should be followed by the head element.
The charset meta element should be added to the head element because the head element is for meta properties (meta properties are properties that work in the background but aren't displayed to the user)
The <title> element should also be added to the <head> element - that becomes the name displayed on the tab.
The <body> element is also added. This is all the user sees on the webpage.
